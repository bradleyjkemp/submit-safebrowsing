### How to use the API

Send a `POST` request to `https://safebrowsing.google.com/safebrowsing/clientreport/crx-report` with the request body being a JSON array:
```json5
[
  "https://suspicious.net/page", // (required) the URL to report
  null,                          // unused field
  "UE5H.......",                 // (optional) screenshot of the malicious site as a base64 encoded PNG
  "<head><body>.......",         // (optional) the DOM of the malicious site
  null,                          // (optional) referrer chain: I've not yet worked out the format for this
  ["flag1", "flag2"],            // (optional) a set of flags for why the site was flagged as suspicious.
                                 // Valid flags are documented here: https://github.com/chromium/suspicious-site-reporter/blob/444666114ec758df1c151514cfd9e2218141da42/extension/alerts.js#L25
]
```

There's some example Go code in this repo but as long as you follow the write request format this'll work in any language.

Happy hunting! ðŸŽ£ 

### Where did this API come from?
Recently I've been submitting a lot of sites to Safe Browsing and found [this](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/suspicious-site-reporter/jknemblkbdhdcpllfgbfekkdciegfboi) Google official Chrome extension which somehow allowed you to submit reports without needing a captcha.

This massively sped up the reporting process but still required some manual effort to open each malicious site and click the report button. Surely I could reverse engineer the extension and find out what API it was submitting to?

A bit of network request sniffing (and later finding the extension was [open source](https://github.com/chromium/suspicious-site-reporter/blob/444666114ec758df1c151514cfd9e2218141da42/extension/client_request.proto#L21)...) and soon enough I'd found both the correct endpoint and request format to submit any site to Safe Browsing.
